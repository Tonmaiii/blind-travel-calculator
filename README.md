# Blind Travel Calculator
A tool to make your blind travel better for people that can't remember the Stronghold rings.
## Getting Started
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Tonmaiii/blind-travel-calculator/releases/tag/1.0.0) and run the jar file. You can right click to close the application. To use the calculator, hit f3+C and your location will be displayed. This can be used when you finished the Nether and want to exit where you will be close to the Stronghold. Navigate to the target position or in the direction of the closest ring. You can keep updating your position as many times as you like until you are in a good position to exit the nether.
